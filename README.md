# pwncat-vl

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/417930.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/417930)

**pwncat-vl** is a community-maintained fork of [pwncat-cs](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat),  
revived to support **modern Python versions (3.13+)** and ensure the tool remains usable for current red team workflows.

---

Originally created by [@calebstewart](https://github.com/calebstewart), `pwncat` is a post-exploitation platform ~~for Linux targets~~.  
It started out as a wrapper around basic bind and reverse shells and has grown from there. It streamlines common red team operations while staging code from your attacker machine, not the target.

The original project has been unmaintained since 2021, and despite community interest and open pull requests, no updates were made.  
Rather than let the project fade away, this fork was created to **fix critical issues, restore compatibility, and keep contributions alive**.

### Key changes in this fork:
- Python **3.13 compatibility**
- Updated dependencies for modern environments
- **Major feature additions**: Network methods, error handling, file transfer enhancements
- **Interactive menu** for improved user experience
- **Advanced C2 channels** (HTTP/HTTPS covert)
- Minimal but active maintenance (contributions welcome!)

---

### Features

pwncat intercepts the raw communication with a remote shell and allows the
user to perform automated actions on the remote host including enumeration,
implant installation and even privilege escalation.

After receiving a connection, pwncat will configure the remote shell:

- Disable shell history
- Normalize shell prompt
- Locate useful binaries (using `which`)
- Attempt to spawn a pseudo-terminal (pty) for full interactive sessions

`pwncat` supports multiple methods for spawning PTYs and cross-references them with available executables on the target system.  
After spawning a PTY, it sets the terminal in raw mode to mimic the behavior of an `ssh` session.

It also synchronizes the remote PTY settings (rows, columns, `TERM`) with your local terminal to ensure proper behavior of interactive applications like `vim` or `nano`.

---

### Platform Support

`pwncat` was initially Linux-only, but the original maintainers began introducing **alpha support for Windows targets**.  
This fork continues to support these efforts but does not introduce new Windows features (yet).

---

### Presentation

John Hammond and Caleb Stewart presented `pwncat` at GRIMMCon.  
You can find the video here: [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CISzI9klRkw).  
This shows an early version \u2014 for current details, refer to this repository.

---

### Requirements

- Python **3.9 to 3.13+**
- Linux (primary support)
- pip / virtualenv recommended

---

### Documentation

Official documentation for the original project was hosted on Read the Docs.  
This fork does not (yet) include RTD integration, but usage remains very similar. Updated instructions are in progress.

## Disclaimer  
This fork is not affiliated with the original author. It exists solely to keep a useful tool alive,  
with full respect and credit given to the original work. Contributions are welcome, and maintenance is ongoing as time permits.


## Installation

`pwncat` only depends on a working Python development environment running on Linux.
In order to install some of the packages required with `pip`, you will likely need
your distribution's "Python Development" package. On Debian based systems,
this is `python-dev`. For Arch, the development files are shipped with the
main Python repository. For Enterprise Linux, the package is named
`python-devel`.

You can install `pwncat-vl` easily using `pipx` (recommended if you want isolation without managing virtualenvs manually):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl
```

If you prefer manual installation from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl.git
cd pwncat-vl
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

For a development environment, `pwncat` uses Python Poetry. You can clone the
repository locally and use Poetry to set up a development environment:

```shell
# Setup pwncat-vl inside a poetry-managed virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl.git
cd pwncat-vl
poetry install

# Enter the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

## Naming Changes

Due to naming conflicts with [Cytopia's pwncat](https://pwncat.org/), the original project was renamed `pwncat-cs`.  
This fork continues under the name **`pwncat-vl`**, and uses the same `pwncat-cs` entrypoint for now,  
but a future update might adjust that for clarity and independence.

## Windows Support

`pwncat` now supports connections from Windows targets starting at `v0.4.0a1`. The Windows
platform utilizes a .Net-based C2 library which is loaded automatically. Windows
targets should connect with either a `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` shell, and
pwncat will take care of the rest.

The libraries implementing the C2 are implemented at [pwncat-windows-c2].
The DLLs for the C2 will be automatically downloaded from the targeted release
for you. If you do not have internet connectivity on your target machine,
you can tell pwncat to pre-stage the DLLs using the `--download-plugins`
argument. If you are running a release version of pwncat, you can also download
a tarball of all built-in plugins from the releases page.

The plugins are stored by default in `~/.local/share/pwncat`, however this is
configurable with the `plugin_path` configuration. If you download the packaged
set of plugins from the releases page, you should extract it to the path pointed
to by `plugin_path`.

Aside from the main C2 DLLs, other plugins may also be available. Currently,
the only provided default plugins are the C2 and an implementation of [BadPotato].
pwncat can reflectively load .Net binaries to be used a plugins for the C2.
For more information on Windows C2 plugins, please see the [documentation].

## Modules

Recently, the architecture of the pwncat framework was redesigned to
incorporate a generic "module" structure. All functionality is now
implemented as modules. This includes enumeration, persistence and
privilege escalation. Interacting with modules is similar to most other
post-exploitation platforms. You can utilize the familiar `run`, `search`
and `info` commands and enter module contexts with the `use` command.
Refer to the documentation for more information.

### Connecting to a Victim

The command line parameters for pwncat attempt to be flexible and accept
a variety of common connection syntax. Specifically, it will try to accept
common netcat and ssh like syntax. The following are all valid:

```sh
# Connect to a bind shell
pwncat-vl connect://10.10.10.10:4444
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10:4444
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10 4444
# Listen for reverse shell
pwncat-vl bind://0.0.0.0:4444
pwncat-vl 0.0.0.0:4444
pwncat-vl :4444
pwncat-vl -lp 4444
# Connect via ssh
pwncat-vl ssh://user:password@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user:password@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl -i id_rsa user@10.10.10.10
# SSH w/ non-standard port
pwncat-vl -p 2222 user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10:2222
# Reconnect utilizing installed persistence
#   If reconnection fails and no protocol is specified,
#   SSH is used as a fallback.
pwncat-vl reconnect://user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl reconnect://user@c228fc49e515628a0c13bdc4759a12bf
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl c228fc49e515628a0c13bdc4759a12bf
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10
```

By default, pwncat **assumes the target platform is Linux**. In order to
connect to a Windows reverse or bind shell, you must pass the `--platform/-m`
argument:

```shell
pwncat-vl -m windows 10.10.10.10 4444
pwncat-vl -m windows -lp 4444
```

You can also start pwncat with an interactive menu for easier navigation:

```shell
pwncat-vl --menu
```

For more information on the syntax and argument handling, see the
help information with ``pwncat-vl --help`` or visit the [documentation].

## Docker Image

The recommended installation method is a Python virtual environment. This
provides the easiest day-to-day usage of `pwncat`. However, there has been
interest in using `pwncat` from a docker image, so I have provided a
Dockerfile which provides a working `pwncat` installation. To build the image
use:

``` shell
docker build -t pwncat .
```

This will build the `pwncat` docker image with the tag "pwncat". The working
directory within the container is `/work`. The entrypoint for the container
is the `pwncat` binary. It can be used like so:

``` shell
# Connect to a bind shell at 10.0.0.1:4444
docker run -v "/some/directory":/work -t pwncat 10.0.0.1 4444
```

In this example, only the files in `/some/directory` are exposed to the container.
Obviously, for upload/download, the container will only be able to see the files
exposed through any mounted directories.

## Features and Functionality

`pwncat` provides two main features. At it's core, it's goal is to automatically
setup a remote PseudoTerminal (pty) which allows interaction with the remote
host much like a full SSH session. When operating in a pty, you can use common
features of your remote shell such as history, line editing, and graphical
terminal applications.

The other half of `pwncat` is a framework which utilizes your remote shell to
perform automated enumeration, persistence and privilege escalation tasks. The
local `pwncat` prompt provides a number of useful features for standard
penetration tests including:

* File upload and download (with recursive support, resume, compression, rate limiting)
* Automated privilege escalation enumeration
* Automated privilege escalation execution
* Automated persistence installation/removal
* Automated tracking of modified/created files
    * `pwncat` also offers the ability to revert these remote "tampers" automatically
* **Port forwarding** (local and remote)
* **SOCKS proxy** (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5)
* **Advanced C2 channels** (HTTP/HTTPS covert)
* **Interactive menu** for improved user experience
* **Enhanced error handling** with automatic recovery
* **Module pattern matching** for easy module discovery
* **Session management** with naming and tagging
* **LinPEAS-style enumeration** for comprehensive privilege escalation checks

The underlying framework for interacting with the remote host aims to abstract
away the underlying shell and connection method as much as possible, allowing
commands and plugins to interact seamlessly with the remote host.

### New Features in v0.6.0

#### Network Methods
- **Port Forwarding**: Forward ports through your session
  ```bash
  forward -L 8080 -h 10.10.10.10 -p 80    # Local forwarding

  ```
- **SOCKS Proxy**: Dynamic port forwarding
  ```bash
  socks -p 1080              # Start SOCKS5 proxy
  socks -p 1080 -v 4         # Start SOCKS4 proxy
  ```

#### File Transfer
- **Recursive Upload**: Upload entire directories
  ```bash
  upload -r /local/dir /remote/dir
  ```

  ```bash
  upload -c large_file.bin
  ```
- **Rate Limiting**: Control upload speed
  ```bash
  upload -l 1048576 file.txt  # 1MB/s
  ```

#### Interactive Menu
Start pwncat with an interactive menu:
```bash
pwncat --menu
```

#### Module System
- **Pattern Matching**: Find modules easily
  ```bash
  match escalate.*           # Find escalation modules
  match linux.enumerate.*   # Find Linux enumeration modules
  ```
- **Enhanced Context**: Better module information
  ```bash
  use linux.enumerate.system.distro
  # Shows detailed module info, arguments, types, defaults
  ```

  ```bash
  sessions --name "web-server" 1
  ```
- **Tagging**: Tag sessions for organization
  ```bash
  sessions --tag "production" 1
  sessions --tag "critical" 1
  ```

#### LinPEAS-style Enumeration
- **Comprehensive Checks**: Run LinPEAS-style enumeration
  ```bash
  run enumerate.linpeas                    # All checks
  run enumerate.linpeas output=report.txt  # Save to file
  run enumerate.linpeas categories=sudo,suid,cron  # Specific categories
  run enumerate.linpeas quiet=true         # Findings only
  ```

#### Customization
- **Color Themes**: Customize your terminal colors
  ```bash
  theme list              # List available themes
  theme set vs            # Change theme
  set color_theme monokai # Via config
  ```
- **Configurable History**: Control command history size
  ```bash
  set history_size 2000
  ```
- **Log Rotation**: Configure log file management
  ```bash
  set log_max_bytes 52428800    # 50MB
  set log_backup_count 10       # 10 backups
  ```

You can learn more about interacting with `pwncat` and about the underlying framework
in the [documentation]. If you have an idea for a new privilege escalation method
or persistence method, please take a look at the API documentation specifically.
Pull requests are welcome!

## Recent Additions (v0.6.0)

Many previously planned features have been implemented:

* ✅ **Network methods**: Port forwarding (local/remote), SOCKS proxy (SOCKS4/5)
* ✅ **File transfer enhancements**: Recursive upload, resume, compression, rate limiting
* ✅ **Error handling**: Centralized error handler with automatic recovery
* ✅ **Module system**: Pattern matching, enhanced context
* ✅ **Session management**: Naming, tagging, improved UI
* ✅ **Interactive menu**: Menu-driven interface for easier use
* ✅ **Advanced C2 channels**: HTTP/HTTPS covert channels
* ✅ **Customization**: Color themes, configurable history, log rotation

## Planned Features

**pwncat** continues to evolve as a red team swiss army knife. Future features may include:

* Persistence methods (bind shell, cronjobs, SSH access, PAM abuse, etc.)
* Aggression methods (spam randomness to terminals, flush firewall, etc.)
* Meme methods (terminal-parrot, cowsay, wall, etc.)
* Resilient sessions (auto-reconnect, state restoration)
* Additional C2 channels (DNS tunneling, ICMP tunneling, WebSocket)

## Known Issues

Because `pwncat` is trying to abstractly interact with any shell with minimal remote system
dependencies, there are some edge cases we have found. Where we find them, we do
everything we can to account for them and hide them from the user. However, some have
slipped through the cracks and been observed in the wild. When this happens, `pwncat`
will do whatever it can to preserve your terminal, but you may be greeted with some
peculiar output or command failures.

### BSD Support

While BSD is a Unix-based kernel, in practice it's userland tools are noticeably
different from their Linux counterparts. Due to this, many of the automated
features of `pwncat` will not work or outright fail when running against a BSD
based target. I have tried to catch all errors or edge cases, however there are
likely some hiccups which haven't been fully tested against BSD. In any case,
the stabilized shell should function within a BSD environment, but I don't
provide any guarantees.

If I find some time later down the road, I may try to stabilize `pwncat` on BSD,
but for now my focus is on Linux-based distributions. If you'd like to
contribute to making `pwncat` behave better on BSD, you are more then welcome to
reach out or just fork the repo. As always, pull requests are welcome!
